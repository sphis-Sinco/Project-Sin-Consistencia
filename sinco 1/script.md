# Chapter 1
A city can be seen, with a giant sign that says "Tempo City" can be seen.
A bright green explosion can be seen in the distance.
And then a green streak can be seen speeding from the explosion to the sign.

The camera changes and we can see Sinco in raggy clothes running around, scared.
And then he speeds away.

"I shouldn't have done that" says Sinco while running away.
